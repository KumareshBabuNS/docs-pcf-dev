## <a id="network"></a>Using PCF Dev Offline

PCF Dev functions largely without a network connection by default, but by setting up a simple DNS redirection you can make it work entirely offline.

###Working Offline with Mac OS X

For OS X we recommend using [Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) as your DNS forwarder. The easiest way to install Dnsmasq is to use the Homebrew package manager. Check that you have Homebrew installed by running `brew -v` in your terminal. If you do not, follow [these instructions](http://brew.sh/) for easy set up. Once you have Homebrew, run these commands to install Dnsmasq:
```
brew update # To update Homebrew
brew install dnsmasq # Install dnsmasq
```
To configure Dnsmasq, copy the example configuration to /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf (check that you do not already have a Dnsmasq configuration file before copying over).
```
cp /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.conf.example /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
```
To have launchd start dnsmasq now and restart at startup, run:
```
sudo brew services start dnsmasq
```
Configure Dnsmasq by editing the file you just placed at `/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf`. We just need to redirect the domain name `local.pcfdev.io` to the IP `192.168.11.11` without requiring a network connection to the resolve the DNS. Do this adding this line:
```
address=/local.pcfdev.io/192.168.11.11
address=/.local.pcfdev.io/192.168.11.11
```
Remember, if the subnet containing `192.168.11.11` is already in use, PCF Dev will pick the next available IP that adheres to the pattern `192.168.xx.11`, and a corresponding system domain. For example, `192.168.44.11` and `local4.pcfdev.io`. If your PCF Dev reports that it is using an alternate configuration when it comes up, use the appropriate combination in your Dnsmasq conf file.

Restart Dnsmasq to ensure it recognizes your change.
```
sudo launchctl stop homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
sudo launchctl start homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
```

To configure your system to use Dnsmasq, go to your network preferences and add 127.0.0.1 as your first DNS server.

###Working Offline with Windows

For Windows, we recommend using Acrylic as your DNS proxy. Download it from [their site](http://mayakron.altervista.org/) and follow the wizard to install it on your system.

After installing, navigate to Start > Programs > Acrylic DNS Proxy > Config > Edit Acrylic Hosts File, then add the following text to the end of the file:
```
192.168.11.11 >local.pcfdev.io # This is equivalent to an entry that redirects both local.pcfdev.io and *.local.pcfdev.io
```
The Acrylic site has detailed instructions to configure your computer to use Acrylic as a DNS server for [Windows 7](http://mayakron.altervista.org/wikibase/show.php?id=AcrylicWindows7Configuration), [Windows 8](http://mayakron.altervista.org/wikibase/show.php?id=AcrylicWindows8Configuration), and [Windows 10](http://mayakron.altervista.org/wikibase/show.php?id=AcrylicWindows10Configuration).

You may need to restart your DNS cache by navigating to Start > Programs > Acrilic DNS Proxy > Config > Restart Acrylic Service.

###Working Offline with Linux

Use your distributionâ€™s package manager to install Dnsmasq on your computer. For example:
```
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
```
Append the following line to /etc/dnsmasq.conf:
```
address=/local.pcfdev.io/192.168.11.11
```
Details on how to configure your computer to use Dnsmasq will differ by distribution. For Ubuntu users, [this blog post](https://www.leaseweb.com/labs/2013/08/wildcard-dns-ubuntu-hosts-file-using-dnsmasq/) from LeaseWeb labs provides more detailed instructions on configuration and troubleshooting.
