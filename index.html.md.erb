This guide describes how to install and use PCF Dev, a lightweight Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; installation that runs on a single virtual machine (VM) on your workstation. PCF Dev is intended for application developers who wish to develop and debug their application locally on a PCF deployment. PCF Dev includes Pivotal Elastic Runtime, Redis, RabbitMQ, and MySQL. It also supports all CF CLI commands. It offers developers access to Redis, RabbitMQ, and MySQL.

PCF Dev is designed to mirror PCF exactly. If an application runs on PCF Dev, it will run on PCF with no modification in almost all cases.

PCF Dev uses VirtualBox as its virtualizer, Vagrant to run its development environment, and the CF CLI to push and scale apps.
