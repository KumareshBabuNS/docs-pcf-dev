### Targeting Your PCF Dev Instance

After installing PCF Dev, please run the following code in your terminal to target your PCF Dev instance:

```
cf api api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation
cf login

Email: admin
Password: admin
```

Your API system domain will be printed when you `vagrant up`. It will most likely be api.local.pcfdev.io, but it may differ slightly depending on your host system configuration.
