### Network Configuration
When running on Virtualbox, PCF Dev will try to use `local.pcfdev.io` as the system domain. Where `*.local.pcfdev.io` resolves to `192.168.11.11`. If the subnet containing `192.168.11.11` is already in use PCF Dev will pick the next available ip that adheres to the pattern `198.168.xx.11` (eg `198.168.44.11`) and a corresponding system domain (e.g. `local4.pcfdev.io`).

If you are launching PCF Dev in AWS the system domain will be the ip of the instance followed by `.xip.io`.

In order to bring up PCF Dev on a custom IP or system domain, you must set the `PCFDEV_IP` and `PCF_DOMAIN` environment variables when starting the cluster.

### Memory & CPU
By default PCF Dev will try to allocate half of the memory available on your host machine with a minimum of 2GB and a maximum of 4GB.

Set the `VM_MEMORY` environment variable to change the allocated memory. This value should be in MB units.

PCF Dev will try to use all host cores. Set the `VM_CORES` environmnet variable to change this behavior.

### Using Vagrant Directly

If you wish, you can use vagrant directly instead of using the provided start, stop, and destroy scripts. To bring up the VM run `vagrant up --provider=<provider>`. To stop the VM run `vagrant halt`. Rerun `vagrant up` to start a stopped VM. `vagrant destroy` will permanently destroy the VM. See the vagrant documentation for more details.
